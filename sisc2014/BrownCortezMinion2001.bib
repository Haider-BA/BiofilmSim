abstract = {This paper considers the accuracy of projection method approximations to the initial–boundary-valueproblemfor the incompressibleNavier–Stokes equations.The issue of how to correctly specify numerical boundary conditions for these methods has been outstanding since the birth of the second-order methodology a decade and a half ago. It has been observed that while the velocity can be reliably computed to second-order accuracy in time and space, the pressure is typically only first-order accurate in the L∞-norm. This paper identifies the source of this problem in the interplay of the global pressure-update formula with the numerical boundary con- ditions and presents an improved projection algorithm which is fully second-order accurate, as demonstrated by a normal mode analysis and numerical experiments. In addition, a numerical method based on a gauge variable formulation of the incom- pressible Navier–Stokes equations, which provides another option for obtaining fully second-order convergence in both velocity and pressure, is discussed. The connec- tion between the boundary conditions for projection methods and the gauge method is explained in detail.},
