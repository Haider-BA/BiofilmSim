abstract = {This paper is concerned with the mathematical structure of the immersed boundary (IB) method, which is intended for the computer simulation of fluid\{structure interaction, especially in biological fluid dynamics. The IB formulation of such problems, derived here from the principle of least ac- tion, involves both Eulerian and Lagrangian variables, linked by the Dirac delta function. Spatial discretization of the IB equations is based on a xed Cartesian mesh for the Eulerian variables, and a moving curvilinear mesh for the Lagrangian variables. The two types of variables are linked by interaction equations that involve a smoothed approximation to the Dirac delta function. Eulerian/Lagrangian identities govern the transfer of data from one mesh to the other. Temporal discretization is by a second-order Runge\{Kutta method. Current and future research directions are pointed out, and applications of the IB method are briefly discussed.}}},
