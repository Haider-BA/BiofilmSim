\begin_layout Abstract
The overall goal of this work is to develop a numerical simulation which
 correctly describes bacterial biofilm fluid-structure interactions and
 separation processes.
 In this, the second of a two-part effort, the primary focus is on validating
 our modeling approach from Part I using data from 
\emph on
Staphalococcus epidermidis 
\emph default
biofilms grown and mechanically characterized in two experimental scenarios.
 The same 
\emph on
Staphalococci 
\emph default
strain and nearly identical nutrient and environmental conditions were used
 in the continuously fed bioreactors for both setups.
 In the first, the bioreactor was incorporated into a parallel plate rheometer,
 while in the second, it was incorporated onto a Quartz Crystal Microbalance.
 Lastly, we also present several strategies for improving the convergence
 rate for the method described in Part I.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In recent years, much work has been done to develop detailed numerical models
 of the fluid structure interactions of bacterial biofilms (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Alpkvist2007,HammondBiofilmNumericsOne2014,Laspidou2014"

\end_inset

).
 In general, the physical properties governing the growth, attachment, and
 detachment of a biofilm are dependent on the extra-cellular matrix (ECM),
 a viscous mixture of polysaccharides and other biological products excreted
 by the bacteria that make up the biofilm.
 The focus of this work is on the biomechanical response of the ECM to fluid
 flow resulting in deformation of the biofilm.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

 shows the five stages of biofilm development, and specifically how the
 production of ECM is crucial to their growth and attachment.
 In the first stage, biofilms attach to a surface and, in the second stage,
 the production of ECM strengthens the attachment.
 In the third and fourth stages, the biofilm develops and matures its architectu
re and, in the final stage of development, the biofilm disperses cells into
 the fluid in order to proliferate.

\begin_layout Standard
In this second paper, we show that the model and simulation method developed
 in part I 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HammondBiofilmNumericsOne2014"

\end_inset

, can be used to predict the material properties of a biofilm and that the
 predictions match well with experimentally determined results.
 We also show that when initializing simulations with experimentally determined
 measurements of the locations of bacteria in slices of biofilms, the physical
 properties obtained through simulation do not significantly vary between
 different biofilms.
 This suggests that the measured quantities are bulk material properties
 of the biofilm.

Need a better way to explain that results are the same if I used different

 Additionally, some suggestions for improving the convergence rate and computati

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, we provide a brief explanation of the model that was originally developed
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 In particular we discuss the model and its relation to the Immersed Boundary
 Method (IBM), a well known computational technique used for
\change_deleted 193460905 1418795697

 the simulation of fluids with around moving, deformable boundaries.
 Next, in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:ConvergenceRate"

\end_inset

, we discuss the numerical properties of the model and provide results showing
 that the model is convergent through convergence rate tests and comparison
 to a simple case in which an analytical solution exists.
 In section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Experimental-Validation"

\end_inset

, we show that the model is capable of reproducing experimental shear moduli
 and compliance modulus data from biofilms grown in a bioreactor and, that
 these properties do not significantly vary when different slices of a biofilm
 are simulated

 We believe that the calculation of bulk material properties of a biofilm
 while directly incorporating microscale fluid structure interactions of
 the biofilm is a novel development.

 Also, in the discrete Dirac delta function, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{h}(\cdot,\,\omega)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 determines the region support of the discrete 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

-function (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:The-Immersed-Boundary-Method"

\end_inset

).
 The exact form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{h}(\cdot,\,\omega)$
\end_inset

 governs how the mass density, viscosity, and force density vary around
 each bacteria and is used to transfer Eulerian grid information to the
 Lagrangian mesh and vice versa.
 .
 Also of note is that in the limit as 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 tends towards 0, the following identity holds:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{U}(\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{q},t),t)\rightarrow\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{q},t),t).
\]

\end_inset

Thus, in the limit of the discretization becoming a continuum, the Lagrangian
 and Eulerian velocities become equivalent.
 This is not true of the Lagrangian and Eulerian force densities since the
 Lagrangian volume element 
\begin_inset Formula $d\mathbf{X}$
\end_inset

 differs from the Eulerian volume element 
\begin_inset Formula $d\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 for all grid spacings 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, even as 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 tends towards 0.
 However, the integral of force density over the volume of the computational
 domain is the same in the Eulerian and Lagrangian frames of reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned above, the model consists of two main pieces; an Eulerian descripti
on of fluid flow through the biofilm, and a Lagrangian description of the
 motion and forces on the bacteria themselves.
 The respective Eulerian and Lagrangian variables are then coupled through
 the use of Delta transfer functions..
 This type of model is an extension of the Immersed Boundary Method.

\end_inset

.
 In IB methods, the fluid velocity fields and pressure are solved for on
 a fixed, Eulerian grid and the movement of the boundaries due to fluid
 motion is tracked on a moving Lagrangian mesh.
 As the material boundaries are deformed, a constitutive model is used to
 determine a force density exerted by the boundary on the fluid around each
 Lagrangian mesh point.
 The Lagrangian force density field is then transferred to an Eulerian force
 density field through the use of a discrete approximation of the following
 identity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)=\int_{\Omega}\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{X},t)\,\delta(\mathbf{X}-\mathbf{x})\, d\mathbf{X}.\label{eq:Euler_Lagrange_Transfer}

The quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}$

 represent the Eulerian force density and coordinates,

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}$
\end_inset

 are the Lagrangian force density and position, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 is the multidimensional Dirac delta function.
 Integration is carried out over the domain of interest, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$

 The effect of the Eulerian force term on the velocity and pressure fields
 is then found by solving the Navier-Stokes equations,

Shows coupling between the Eulerian and Lagrangian variables that is characteris
tic of Immersed Boundary Methods.
 The Eulerian velocity and pressure fields are updated by solving the Navier-Sto
kes equations.
 The Eulerian velocity is also tied to the Lagrangian velocity which is
 used to update the Lagrangian node positions.
 These node positions determine the Lagrangian force density, viscosity
 and mass density.
 In turn, these are coupled through a 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

-function to the Eulerian quantities.
 These quantities are present in the Navier-Stokes equations and thus effect
 the Eulerian velocity and pressure fields.

Upon discretizing, the integration in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is carried out by computing a sum of the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_{i},t_{j})=\sum_{k}\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{X}_{k},t_{j})\,\delta_{h}(\mathbf{X}_{k}-\mathbf{x}_{i},\omega)\, h^{3},\label{eq:EulerLagrangeForce}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the Eulerian and Lagrangian forces are evaluated at the Eulerian and
 Lagrangian grid points respectively, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{h}(\cdot,\omega)$
\end_inset

is a discrete approximation of the Dirac delta function parametrized by,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 which determines the region of support.
 In the original IBM as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Peskin2002"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 scales with the Eulerian grid spacing, 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, and the discrete Dirac delta approximation is chosen such that as 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 approaches 0, the discrete approximation approaches the true Dirac delta
 function.
 This is done since the original IBM was developed for fluid structure interacti
ons involving an infinitessimally thin fluid-solid boundary that has zero
 volume.
 In biofilm modeling, the permeation of fluid throughout the entire biofilm
 is essential and, in most biofilms, there exist no distinct fluid-biofilm
 boundaries.
 Therefore, we choose a fixed value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 independent of the grid spacing that corresponds to a hydrodynamic radius
 over which an individual bacterium and any molecules extruding from its
 surface may directly influence fluid flow fields.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This modification does have the negative consequence of losing two desirable
 conditions that were previously satisfied by the Dirac delta approximation,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{h}$

 If we let

\end_inset

 be of the form,

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(r)$
\end_inset

 as defined in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

are both satisfied.
 However, even with a grid-independent choice for 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, in the limit as 
\begin_inset Formula $h\rightarrow0$

 Although IB methods with variable density have existed for some time, the
 incorporation of spatially variable viscosity in the IBM is an area that
 has yet to be well developed.
 We do, however, note the recent publications, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, in which an IBM capable of solving problems with variable viscosity and

couple the immersed viscoelastic structure to the fluid flow in an immersed
 boundary type formulation, but they solve the fluid equations separately
 from the equations governing the motion of the immersed viscoelastic solid
 and then couple the solutions at their physical interface

.
 This formulation will not work in our case because we couple the biofilm
 to the fluid in the entire domain so that it will behave as a viscoelastic
 fluid.
 Another approach to including viscosity into the immersed boundary method
 is by replacing the simple elastic springs with viscoelastic links, which
 will change the value of the external force, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}$
\end_inset

, in the Navier-Stokes equations

\begin_layout Standard
In biofilms, the variance in the physical properties of the biofilm is localized
 around each bacteria position, while in fluid far away from any bacteria,
 the physical properties are those of the bulk fluid, for instance water.
 This localization of the variation in physical properties indicates that
 the spatial variation in density and viscosity may be determined using
 a similar discrete 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

-function method as is used to distribute the Lagrangian force.
 However, a key differnce is that the viscosity may have a different radial
 variation than the force.
 We denote this different delta-type function as 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{\mu}(\mathbf{r},\omega)$
\end_inset

 .
 Therefore, we define an effective viscosity, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{b}$
\end_inset

and an effective density, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{b}$
\end_inset

and assume that at the center of mass of each bacteria, the viscosity and
 density are 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathbf{X}_{i},t)=\rho_{0}+\rho_{b}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(\mathbf{X}_{i},t)=\mu_{0}+\mu_{b}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{0}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{0}$
\end_inset

are the bulk density and viscosity of the pure fluid.
 With these definitions, the viscosity at any Eulerian grid points can be
 calculated as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu(\mathbf{x})=\mu_{0}+\int_{\Omega}\mu_{b}\,\delta_{\mu}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{q}),\omega)\,\mathrm{d}\mathbf{X}.
\]

\end_inset

 It should also be noted that we currently do not take into account the
 fluid displacement caused by the presence of bacteria or the shape of the
 individual bacteria (unless they are spherical).
 Further extensions based on changing our choice for 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{\mu}(\mathbf{x},\omega)$
\end_inset

 could possibly allow for the inclusion of this physical property into the
 model.

 Notice too, that the values of

\end_inset

 are exactly zero for certain relationships between 
\begin_inset Formula $h$

.
 For example, if 
\begin_inset Formula $h=\frac{\omega}{z}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $z\in\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{unity}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{mom}$
\end_inset

 are exactly zero when using 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus if our problem allows for 
\begin_inset Formula $h=\frac{\omega}{z}$
\end_inset

, then we would use 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 However, with the choices we have made for 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h$

 in our numerical scheme, it is a better choice to use 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{2}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many Immersed Boundary type methods exhibit 1st order convergence in time.
 This comes partly from the uncoupling of the Lagrangian position updates
 from the fluid equation solutions and also partly due to the nature of
 the discrete 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 approximation.
 One possible way to improve convergence is through implicitly solving the
 coupled Eulerian Fluid equations (Navier Stokes 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:N-S"

\end_inset

), and the Lagrangian particle position equations.
 Additionally, higher order convergence may be obtained by adjusting the
 method of the solving the Navier-Stokes equations.
 Currently, we use a projection method, similar to that used in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Zhu2003"

\end_inset

.
 This projection type of solver uses the implicit Euler equation to update
 an intermediate velocity profile at each time step.
 However, it can be shown using normal mode analysis, that this will lead
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(\Delta t)$
\end_inset

 convergence.
 On the other hand, at least in the constant viscosity and density case,
 using a Crank-Nicholson scheme for the intermediate velocity solver will
 lead to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^{2})$

 convergence as shown in

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Until recently, the material characterization of bacterial biofilms has
 proven difficult to determine experimentally.
 It is difficult to grow large enough biofilms for use in standard testing
 devices, and attempts to move a biofilm from the environment it was grown
 in to a testing apparatus may cause it to become dehydrated or otherwise
 damage it (citations).
 In some recent experiments
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pavlovsky2013"

\end_inset

, a promising method of testing material properties was used to obtain material
 properties of a biofilm.
 Additionally, we obtained positional data on bacteria locations within
 biofilms from this experimental work.
 Using the numerical model described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HammondBiofilmNumericsOne2014"

\end_inset

, we use the experimentally obtained bacteria positions to initialize the
 biofilm model, and show that similar physical results are found through
 simulation.
 Additionally, we show that these results are not heavily dependent on the
 precise positions of bacteria in the biofilm, but on the larger scale structure
 of the biofilm.
 In other words, given two biofilms grown in similar conditions, it would
 be expected that they will exhibit similar physical properties, thus the
 properties we determine can be treated as bulk properties of the biofilm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Computation of Stress and Strains
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few material properties can be measured just from knowing the relationships
 between the stress and strain at the upper or lower edge of the domain
 of simulation.
 In order to compute these quantities, we break up the stress, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 and strain, 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 into the component due to the fluid motion, 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon^{f}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{f}$
\end_inset

, and the component due to the biofilm 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon^{b}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{b}$
\end_inset

.
 Then the total stress and strain are found as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma=\sigma^{b}+\sigma^{f}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\epsilon=\epsilon^{b}+\epsilon^{f}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the total stress and strain appear linear in each component, this
 is misleading since changing properties of the biofilm will effect the
 fluid flow and vice versa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Computation of Strain Induced by Fluid 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although a pure fluid will behave viscously, (i.e.
 the stress only depends on the strain rate, not strain itself), in the
 biofilm, the fluid is influenced by the elastic components of the biofilm
 and thus fluid strain should be measured.
 From a Lagrangian viewpoint, the displacement of each particle in a fluid
 can be found by solving the following ODE:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\mathbf{d}^{f}(\mathbf{x}_{0},\, t)=\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{x}_{0},\, t)+\mathbf{x}_{0},\, t)\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{x}_{0},\,0)=\mathbf{0}.
\]

\end_inset

In order to avoid excessive computational costs associated with tracking
 every single point in the discretization, a subset, 
\begin_inset Formula ${\mathbf{S}_{i}}$
\end_inset

 are chosen.
 In the simulations, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{yz}$
\end_inset

 component of strain is needed at the upper boundary of the domain.
 Therefore, the tracer particles are initialized so that they are near the
 top and, so that numerical computation of derivatives of the form, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial d_{z}^{f}}{\partial y}$
\end_inset

 would is easy to compute.
 This is achieved by creating three vertically aligned layers of tracer
 particles at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, for each tracer particle in the middle layer, there is a particle
 directly above and directly below it initially.
 As the biofilm is deformed, the finite difference approximation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\epsilon_{yz}^{f}(\mathbf{S},\, t)\approx\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial d_{z}^{f}}{\partial y}\right)\approx\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}\frac{d_{z}^{f}(\mathbf{S}_{i})-d_{z}^{f}(\mathbf{S}_{i-h})}{S_{i,\, y}-S_{i-h,\, y}}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{d_{z}^{f}(\mathbf{S}_{i+h})-d_{z}^{f}(\mathbf{S}_{i})}{S_{i+h,\, y}-S_{i,\, y}}\right)
\]

\end_inset

is then used to approximate the strain.
 Since every position at the upper plate moves at a single velocity at any
 given time, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial d_{y}^{f}}{\partial z}$
\end_inset

 which generally shows up in the strain formula, is negligible.
 The reported 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{yz}^{f}$
\end_inset

 at each time step is then the average of the strains calculated at each
 tracer position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Computation of Stress Induced by the Fluid
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From Newton's viscosity law, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma_{yz}^{f}=\mu(\mathbf{x})\left(\frac{\partial u_{z}}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial u_{y}}{\partial z}\right).
\]

\end_inset

Since the fluid field is already known from solving the Navier-Stokes equations
 at each time step, the relevant derivates can be easily approximated by
 finite difference approximations.
 As with the strain calculation, the second term, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial u_{y}}{\partial z}$
\end_inset

, is negligible since the top plate does not have a spatially varying velocity.
 The reported value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{yz}^{f}$
\end_inset

 at each time step is then found by spatially averaging over a small volume
 near the top of the domain.
 This is done instead of just averaging over the very top of the domain
 in case there are any oddities in the fluid flow field at the boundary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Computation of the Strain Induced by the Biofilm Node Locations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the strain induced by the fluid tracer particle positions,
 there is also a strain derived from conformational changes in the node
 locations of the biofilm as deformation occurs.
 In this case, the strain, 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{yz}^{b}$
\end_inset

 can be calculated at the upper plate by considering bacteria nodes within
 some distance, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1}$
\end_inset

 of the upper plate.
 For each node, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{i}$
\end_inset

, finite difference formulas are then used to calculate derivatives of displacem
ent in the 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 direction for all neighbors, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{j}$
\end_inset

 such that the 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

-components of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{j}$
\end_inset

 differ by some other distance 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 This is done is it was found to improve numerical accuracy.
 The strain at each 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is then the average of the finite difference approximations, and the overall
 strain, 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{yz}^{b}$
\end_inset

 is the average of the strain at each point.

One way to characterize viscoelastic materials is through their frequency
 dependent response to a periodic strain.
 For a general viscoelastic material, given that the stress and strain are
 sufficiently smooth functions of time, the relation between the stress
 and strain may be written in terms of a viscoelasticity tensor using Boltzmann'
s integral formula as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is the stress tensor, 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{ij}$

\end_inset

 is a fourth order viscoelasticity tensor

\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{G}_{ijkl}=\hat{\delta}_{ij}\hat{\delta}_{kl}\tilde{G}{}_{1}+\hat{\delta}_{ij}\tilde{G}_{2}$

When a nearly isotropic material is subjected to a periodic displacement
 field at frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, we may write the strain as 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon(t)=i\omega\thinspace\epsilon_{0}e^{i\omega t}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is the imaginary unit and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the strain amplitude.
 Using the Boltzmann integral formula, we obtain the following result, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma(\omega)=G(\omega)\epsilon(\omega)
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $G(\omega$
\end_inset

) is the Fourier transform in time of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{G}(t)$
\end_inset

.
 In general 
\begin_inset Formula $G(\omega)$
\end_inset

 is a complex valued function.
 For cases where the strain is primarily only shear strain, we can say that
 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{ijkl}\approx\hat{\delta}_{ij}G_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Breaking the complex shear modulus into its real and imaginary components,
 
\begin_inset Formula $G(\omega)=G^{\prime}(\omega)+iG^{\prime\prime}(\omega)$
\end_inset

; and given a strain amplitude 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{0}(\omega)$
\end_inset

 (in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu m/\mu m$
\end_inset

) and stress amplitude 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}(\omega)$
\end_inset

 (in Pascal), we can write
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
G^{\prime}(\omega)=\frac{\sigma_{0}(\omega)}{\epsilon_{0}(\omega)}\cos\delta(\omega),\qquad G^{\prime\prime}(\omega)=\frac{\sigma_{0}(\omega)}{\epsilon_{0}(\omega)}\sin\delta(\omega).\label{eq:DynamicModuli}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(\omega)$
\end_inset

 is the phase lag in radians between the stress and strain curves at frequency
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, one of the experimental methods used to characterize biofilms is small
 amplitude rheometry (SAR).
 In SAR, a biofilm is grown such that it adheres to two circular plates
 separated by a distance, 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

.
 The upper plate is then rotated periodically such that the strain amplitude
 at the top of the biofilm is a fixed value and the corresponding stress
 is measured.
 Experimentally, the strain amplitude was set to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.13m/m$
\end_inset

 at the outer radius of the rheometer.
 This value of the strain amplitude corresponds to approximately 10% of
 the strain required to cause the biofilm connections to break, and corresponds
 to mostly elastic deformation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Pavlovsky2013"

\end_inset

.
 Using 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:DynamicModuli"

\end_inset

, the dynamic moduli are then computed at various frequencies to analyze
 the frequency dependence of 
\begin_inset Formula $G^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G^{\prime\prime}$
\end_inset

.
 With our model, we assume that for a small chunk of the biofilm that is
 not near the rotational center or the outer boundary of the disc, the effects
 of cylindrical geometry are not crucial and the rotational motion appears
 almost as linear shear.
 This reduces the computational expense and obviates any need to simulate
 the entire biofilm which consists of millions of bacteria.
 Instead pieces of the biofilm with between 500 and 1000 bacteria are used
 in the simulations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To understand why this approximation of the cylindrical geometry is valid,
 we note that the size of the bioreactor used experimentally is 
\begin_inset Formula $11mm$
\end_inset

 in diameter whereas, currently the experimental domain is only 
\begin_inset Formula $9\mu m$
\end_inset

 in width.
 Therefore, if we take the experimental domain to be near, but not on the
 edge of the experimental bioreactor, we see that the curvature of the front
 and back walls of the computational domain should be approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{11000\mu m}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the error in the curvature is less than 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1\%$
\end_inset

 when assuming that the domain is a rectangular solid.
 Additionally, the change in angle (in radians) of the left and right side
 of the domain (
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.9$
\end_inset

), a distance of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.9\mu m$
\end_inset

 would be 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi\cdot\frac{0.9}{11000}=5.14\cdot10^{-4}rad$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, approximating the domain as being rectangular should cause only negligibl
e differences in results.

 directions (see figure
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) .
 To capture the shearing motion of the upper plate, we use the following
 boundary conditions:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ccc}
\left.\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right|_{y=0,H}=0\quad & \mathbf{u}(x,0,z,t)=0\quad & \mathbf{u}(x,H,z,t)=(0\:,0\:,u_{b}(t)\,)\end{array}

Along the top boundary, we set the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 velocity to be 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
u_{b}(t)=\frac{(e^{2\omega t}-1)((e^{4\omega t}-1)\cos\omega t+8e^{2\omega t}\sin\omega t)}{4(1+e^{2\omega t})^{3}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This particular function is chosen since it has continuous derivatives,
 thus avoiding any discontinuities in the observed variables at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

, and because it rapidly converges to 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos\omega t$
\end_inset

 after a single oscillation, reducing the amount of time needed to run simulatio
ns.
 However, there are of course many other suitable functions.
 To initialize the bacteria positions, we take a subset of a 
\begin_inset Formula $31\mu m\times31\mu m\times10\mu m$
\end_inset

 bacteria position data field obtained experimentally.
 This data is also used to initialize the viscosity and density fields present
 in the biofilm.
 We assume the biofilm experiences no internal forces or stresses at time
 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

.
 We believe this to be reasonable since experimental results from SAR experiment
s under both compression and tension yielded similar results.
\end_layout

In order to tune our model to the experimental data, we adjusted the spring

 used in Hooke's Law and the distance by which we allow any two biofilm
 nodes to be connected by at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

.
 We also examined the effect of including a damping term in the Lagrangian
 force calculations.
 In other words, instead of setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}_{ij}=k\, D(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{X}_{0})\,(\mathbf{X}_{i}-\mathbf{X}_{j})$
\end_inset

, we use 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}_{ij}=k\, D_{1}(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{X}_{0})\,(\mathbf{X}_{i}-\mathbf{X}_{j})+b\, D_{2}(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{U})\,(\mathbf{U}_{i}-\mathbf{U}_{j})$
\end_inset

.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $b=0$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to Hooke's Law and 
\begin_inset Formula $b>0$
\end_inset

 includes damping.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $D(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{X}_{0})$
\end_inset

 is used to specify the angle of the spring connection relative to the original
 position at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to measure the stress and strain exerted by the biofilm on the
 top plate, we must take into accout the contributions to stress and strain
 from the fluid motion in the biofilm and from the elastic spring-like connectio
ns between bacteria .
 In general, the components of the strain tensor of a material can be accurately
 approximated by the following formula: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\epsilon}_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}(d_{i,j}+d_{j,i})$
\end_inset

 so long as the deformations are small.
 Since we use small strain amplitudes, we believe this assumption to be
 accurate in this case.
 The terms 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i,j}=\frac{\partial d_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}$
\end_inset

 represent the derivatives of the displacement field with respect to the
 Cartesian directions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the fluid, the displacement field, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{d}^{f}(\mathbf{x_{0}},t)$
\end_inset

 is found by tracking the position of each parcel of fluid throughout the
 simulation.
 This is equivalent to integrating the following equation: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\mathbf{d}^{f}(\mathbf{x}_{0},t)=\mathbf{u}^{f}(\mathbf{d}^{f}(\mathbf{x}_{0},t)+\mathbf{x}_{0},t)\quad & \mathbf{d}^{f}(\mathbf{x}_{0},t=0)=0.
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To avoid the excessive cost of tracking every fluid particle, we therefore
 choose a subset of fluid particles, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{S}_{i}$
\end_inset

 near the top of the domain to trace, where we hope to compute the strain.
 The particles are chosen in triplets such that each triplet is aligned
 vertically at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

.
 The strain at the top plate is then calculated at the center particle of
 each triple by the following formula
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\epsilon_{yz}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial d_{z}^{f}}{\partial y}\approx\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}\frac{d_{z}^{f}(\mathbf{S}_{i})-d_{z}^{f}(\mathbf{S}_{i-h})}{S_{i,\, y}-S_{i-h,\, y}}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{d_{z}^{f}(\mathbf{S}_{i+h})-d_{z}^{f}(\mathbf{S}_{i})}{S_{i+h,\, y}-S_{i,\, y}}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The overall strain at the top is the found as the average strain for triplet.
 In simulations, 36 triples were used and were evenly spaced near the top
 of the computational domain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To find the displacement, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{d}^{b}(\mathbf{x},t)$
\end_inset

, of the component of the biofilm, we simply subtract the biofilm positions
 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 from their initial positions.
 Derivatives of the displacement are then found by averaging terms of the
 form
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial d_{z}^{f}(\mathbf{X}_{i})}{\partial y}\approx\frac{d_{z}^{b}(\mathbf{X}_{i})-d_{z}^{b}(\mathbf{X}_{j})}{X_{i,\, y}-X_{j,\, y}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the biofilm position at which we want to calculate the 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{zy}$
\end_inset

 strain component and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{k,\, y}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

-component of the coordinate vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Averaging is done over each 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{j}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{j}$
\end_inset

 are connected by a single spring.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total strain is then the sum elastic strain and the fluid strain.
 Although the elastic strain is computed purely by consideration strain
 induced by the positions of the bacteria nodes, and the fluid strain field
 is computed only by integrating the fluid velocity field over time, there
 is coupling between these two quantities since the fluid velocity field
 is influenced by the forces exerted as the biofilm is strained and vice
 versa.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, the stresses on the top wall must be calculated.
 Again, we brake up the stress calculation into a term that is computed
 from the fluid velocity field, and a term that depends on the bacterial
 node configuration.
 For the fluid portion, the stress is calculated according to Newton's viscosity
 law as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{i,j}^{f}=\mu(\mathbf{x})\left(\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}+\frac{\partial u_{j}}{\partial x_{i}}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
In this particular simulation, we are concerned only with the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{zy}^{f}$
\end_inset

 component of the stress tensor, thus for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}=(u,\, v,\, w),$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{zy}^{f}=\mu(\mathbf{x})\left(\frac{\partial w}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial v}{\partial z}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 For the stress induced by the elastic component of the biofilm, we integrate
 the Eulerian force density induced by the biofilm nodes attached to the
 top wall over the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

.
 In the simulation, we specify that these nodes remain adherent to the wall,
 and thus any force transmitted to these nodes provides a measure of the
 elastic tension being exerted on the upper wall.
 It also should be noted that the force exerted by these nodes on the fluid
 is precisely 0 since they are not free to move.
 Any force exerted on these nodes is balanced out exactly by a normal force
 transmitted by the wall on these nodes.
 Thus, in the calculation of the Eulerian force term in the Navier-Stokes
 equations, the contribution from these nodes is 0.
 However, the force exerted by the biofilm on the wall is the force accumulated
 at these nodes.
 Along this reasoning we have, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{\mathscr{F}}^{b}=\int_{\Omega}\mathbf{f}^{b}(\mathbf{x})d\mathbf{x}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f^{b}(\mathbf{x})}$
\end_inset

 is the Eulerian force density exerted by the biofilm on these nodes which
 are adhered to the upper plate.
 The field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{b}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is not part of the forcing, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 term in the Navier-Stokes equation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now to calculate the stress, we use Cauchy's traction law, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\mathbf{n}=\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is the stress tensor, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 normal vector (to the top wall), and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 is a traction.
 Since the upper plate is simply an 
\begin_inset Formula $xz$
\end_inset

-plane, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}=<0\:-1\:0>$
\end_inset

.
 The traction, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 is calculated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}=\frac{\mathbf{\mathscr{F^{b}}}}{A}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the area of the upper plate.
 Since we are only concerned with the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{yz}^{b}$
\end_inset

component of the shear, this only requires use of the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 component of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\mathscr{F}}^{b}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{yz}^{b}=\frac{\mathbf{\mathscr{-F}}^{b}}{A}$
\end_inset

.
 As with the strain, the total stress is computed by the summation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{b}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{f}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:G1_G2_vs_w"

\end_inset

 we show several plots of the frequency dependence of 
\begin_inset Formula $G^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G^{\prime\prime}$
\end_inset

 versus 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
 The range of frequencies is between 
\begin_inset Formula $1.254\, rad/s$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $63.86\, rad/s$
\end_inset

.
 Lower frequency data, though experimentally available was not tested due
 to stability constraints on the numerical method.
 As mentioned in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HammondBiofilmNumericsOne2014"

\end_inset

, the time step is constrained in some way by the magnitude of the force
 term.
 At low frequencies, we cannot arbitrarily increase the time step since
 the force does not significantly decrease at low frequencies.
 Thus, simulation of one period of oscillation at the lowest frequencies
 takes many times more time steps as needed for the high frequency simulations.
 Possible solutions to this issue would be a reformulation of the solvers
 to make the force and position updates of the biofilm implicit, although
 this may be computationally expensive as well since it would involve solving
 a larger system of equations.
 Another approach is to use a predictor-corrector type of method such as
 the approach described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FaiPeskin2013"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Peskin2002"

\end_inset

.
 Another direction would be to increase the level of parallelism in the
 code so that all simulations can be run more quickly, thus the low frequency
 simulations may not be so prohibitively expensive.
 Since the numerical algorithm relies heavily on multigrid methods, and
 there is significant literature on parallel multigrid algorithms, this
 may be an effective remedy for certain frequencies.

\begin_layout Subsection
Compliance Measurements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another experimentally measurable physical of biofilms is the compliance.
 The compliance is measured by applying a step change in the stress on the
 upper plate.
 The resulting strain in the biofilm near the top plate can then be measured
 using the following relation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\epsilon(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{t}J(t-\tau)\frac{\mathrm{d}\sigma(t)}{\mathrm{d\tau}}\,\mathrm{d}\tau
\]

\end_inset

For a step change in the applied stress, 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\sigma}(t)=\sigma_{0}\delta(t)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the value of the step change in the stress and, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(t)$
\end_inset

 is the Dirac delta function .
 Thus the integral simplifies to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\epsilon(t)=\sigma_{0}J(t)
\]

\end_inset

a simple relation to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $J(t)$
\end_inset

.
 In the case of biofilms, there may be depedence of 
\begin_inset Formula $J(t)$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $J(t)$
\end_inset

 is measured for several different values in the step change.
 For small values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}$
\end_inset

, and over short timescales, one would expect that the 
\begin_inset Formula $J(t)$
\end_inset

 will settle after finite time to some finite value, whereas for large values
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}$
\end_inset

 one would expect the biofilm to become dettached from the upper plate,
 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $J(t)$
\end_inset

 would be unbounded and the biofilm will see fluid like strains.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the biofilm model, the an impulse boundary condition is used on the
 top plate to simulate the application of a stress to the top of the biofilm.
 This is done using the relation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{d}{dt}u_{z}(H)=(\rho V)^{-1}(\sigma_{0}-\sigma_{b}-\sigma_{f})A
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{b}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{f}$
\end_inset

 are the stress exerted by the fluid and the springs in the biofilm at the
 top wall, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the area of the upper plate, and 
\begin_inset Formula $(\rho V)$
\end_inset

 is the mass associated with the bacteria and fluid located near the top
 plate that are directly influenced by the application of a stress to the
 top plate.
 Most of the bacteria and the bulk of the fluid only feel the effect of
 the step in stress after this has had time to propogate vertically through
 the biofilm, however, the section of biofilm located very close to the
 upper plate immediately is effected by a change in stress at the top of
 the biofilm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Numerically, this boundary condition can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u^{(n+1)}=u^{(n)}+\left(\frac{1}{\rho_{0}u_{0}L\sum\rho_{ijk}}\right)(\sigma_{0}-\sigma_{b}-\sigma_{f}).
\]

\end_inset

In numerical experiments, rather than immediately impose a step in stress
 at time 0, we add a very small first order element, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\frac{2}{1-e^{-Kt}}-1\right)$
\end_inset

 on the applied stress, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}$
\end_inset

 to mitigate any possible numerical instabilities associated with a discontinuou
s boundary condition.
 Results from simulations using this boundadry condition and several values
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}$
\end_inset

 are shown in figure FIGURE.

In this paper, we do not propose mechanisms by which the springs may break

 Thus, the long term behavior of

\end_inset

 which depends on the gradual redistribution of the connectivity biofilm
 would not be captured.
 Therefore, we do not simulate beyond 5 seconds at which time a plateau
 in the compliance is observed both experimentally and in our simulations.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order for the model to yield useful results, it must be the case that
 the bulk physical properties measured do not depend heavily on the specific
 positions of the bacteria in the biofilm, which could be highly variable
 between two biofilms, but on the general placement of bacteria within a
 biofilm.
 In other words, if we take a 
\begin_inset Formula $9\mu m$
\end_inset

 wide, 
\begin_inset Formula $9\mu m$
\end_inset

 long, and 
\begin_inset Formula $18\mu m$
\end_inset

 high section of the experimental data, the similar rheological properties
 should be observed regardless of which section is used in the simulation.
 Clearly, if a small enough section is taken, at some point, the individual
 bacteria locations do become substantial, but we show that at the scale
 of our simulations, the properties we measure are bulk properties that
 are not heavily dependent on which section we simulate.
 Given bacteria position data from several biofilms, we test this notion
 by simulating with the same boundary conditions as the tests in section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Shear-Moduli"

\end_inset

.
 However, instead of varying the frequency of oscillation, we keep a fixed
 value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 and use experimental data from different biofilms to initialize the simulations.

Results from Simuluation 5 appear quite different, however, this seems as
 though it is likely due to the fact that this simulation only involved
 523 bacteria nodes, whereas all other simulations had at least 800.
 Additionally, the experimental procedure leading to the position data for
 simulation 5 was conducted at a higher temperature than the experiments
 leading to the other 4 simulations.
 There appears to be some dependence on both 
\begin_inset Formula $G^{'}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G^{\prime\prime}$
\end_inset

 with the number of bacteria present in the simulated domain.

The fact that different experimental sections of the biofilm have similar
 rheological properties is significant because it seems to indicate that
 biofilms are not haphazardly organized collections of bacteria, but that
 there could be some type of principle by which bacteria organize themselves
 within the biofilm to provide desirable biological properties to the biofilm.

A distinct physical property of bacterial biofilms that can be observed
 is that they may tumble certain fluid flow conditions.
 In this simulation, we keep the same physical parameters as in the previous
 sections, but change the boundary conditions.
 In this case, there are no bacteria anchored along the walls of the domain.
 Instead, the biofilm is located in the middle of the computational domain
 and the walls move in opposite directions.
 In particular, the bottom wall.
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$
\end_inset

 moves according to the function 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{z}(x,0,z)=\frac{-2}{1+e^{-t}}+1
\]

\end_inset

and the top wall moves according to the function,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{Z}(x,H,z)=\frac{2}{1+e^{-t}}-1
\]

\end_inset

to ensure that the biofilm is not attached to the walls and is sufficiently
 far from the wall to induce a rotating, or tumbling motion, we allow the
 biofilm only to contain nodes that are at least XXXXX number of micrometers
 from either wall.
 From this numerical experiment, we measure the tumbling frequency of the
 biofilm to be XXXXX for a biofilm with XXXX nodes in it and with approximate
 radius XXXX micrometers.

Conclusions(will change a lot once I finish all simulations)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the experimental results shown above and in (previous paper), we
 show that the proposed model can accurately describe key physical properties
 of bacterial biofilms.
 In particular, we show that the model yields close agreement with experimental
 results from (cite sources) in which the bacterium S.
 Epidermis was used.
 Possible future work would include accounting for some physical effects
 which we do not currently incorporate.
 These include the finite size and shape of bacteria in a biofilm and more
 complex modeling of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

springs
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 connecting bacteria.
 Additionally, further work could still be done to improve the convergence
 rate and accuracy of the numerical simulations.
