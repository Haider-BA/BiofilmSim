abstract = {This paper provides analytical solutions to the generalized Fisher equation with a class of time varying diffusion coefficients. To accomplish this we use the Painlev\'{e} property for partial differential equations as defined by Weiss in 1983 in ‘‘The Painlev\'{e} property for partial- differential equations’’. This was first done for the variable coefficient Fisher’s equation by \"{O}g˘\"{u}n and Kart in 2007; we build on this work, finding additional solutions with a weaker restriction on the trial solution. We also use the same technique to find solutions to Fisher’s equation with time-dependent coefficients for both diffusion and nonlinear terms. Lastly we compute specific solutions to illustrate their behaviors.},
